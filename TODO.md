# TODO

- Get a MCU that can emulate a keyboard, move all code to MCU
- Add other letters

- Get a better joystick - linear, no deadzone, less force
- Add key switches 
  - multiple typing layers. How to do ctrl, shift, alt, etc.
  - Maybe add 4/5 way switches for many actions per finger
- Make a PCB for it! One handed would be easiest I think, and that would let me type 

- Arrange letters by common pairs - e.g H should be close to C, S, T etc (CH, SH, TH are common)
  Unlike a keyboard, travel time between letters matters (in theory, maybe this is a premature optimization)
- Arrange letters so more common letters are close to the center
